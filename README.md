# üìê Math from the Ground Up: A First Principles Computational Library

This project is an effort to build core mathematical concepts and algorithms in Python, starting from first principles (pure logic gates) and progressing toward advanced topics like Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Machine Learning...

### Current status
* **basic integer arithmetic**: binary integer addition, subtraction, multiplication and division from logic
* **set theory basics**: custom set class and its basic operations (union, intersection, difference...)
* **relations & functions**: Defined ordered pairs (from sets), cartesian products, and functions as special relations. Includes logic to validate functions and find their domain and range.
